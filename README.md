# analysis-scripts
Jupyter notebooks with analysis scripts to evaluate my phd thesis code results

Currently in generations_plot.ipynb file I have a simple script implemented with the functionalities: 
  1. Main Objetive: Plot the generations distribution over the objective functions sufarce:
      1.1. Plot the level curve of function;
      1.2. Plot the generation distribuition;
      1.3. Plot the clusters generated in each generation;

Obs.: I work with optmization and evolutionary computing in my phd research, so: Generation = Set of solutions for the optmization problems (or Population) in each iteration of evolutioray algorithm
